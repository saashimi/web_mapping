turf.js mapping library

leaflet quick start

Lat & long - wgs84

Every ColorBrewer Scale

=======
Class 2

256px x 256px
Mapbox MapZen

Mapbox uses UTF grid

=======
Class 3

Coordinates & Precision - 6 decimals
Winding order: outer = clockwise
               inner = counterclockwise

leaflet quirks: passing null

============
Cl 4
Layers collect events and data.
Panes organize them automatically. 
Know the default leaflet panes. Joe makes custom panes.
Layer updates: give each feature some ID.
to count features in a layer, use getLayer()
const
=>
`
{}

*Make your own AJAX call.

============
Cl 5
trimet.org/destinations
Mapboxjs extends leaflet classes.
* Tiles are more efficient than geojson data.
pbf - protocol buffer tiles

============
Cl 6
Mapbox GL - webGL
Sources vs layers.
Data can be static and dynamic.
Quadtrees

============
Cl 7 
Today's topic is basic API requests.
newline delimited text - can display points right away while waiting for the rest of the data to load. VS CSV, which requires to load the headings and the first line to make sense of the data.

Node and streams: pipe many things together
Node modules should do one thing well and one thing only.

ws = write stream
web sockets

npm install
npm install -g serve
npm start

=============
Class Project
=============
S. China Sea
HK land fill over time
PDX Student Addresses Over time

Cl 8
====
ndjson-based workflow
json map is extremely powerful for javascript expressions. Think math, string management, etc.
you can pop this back out into geojson by adding the appropriate objects
====

toposimplify -p 1 -f < garbage.topojson > garbage-simple.topojson
data.objects[feature]
NYC planning tile script
add layer with
tiles: []
node fs api
Tile servers

=========
Cl 9
Joe uses tape javascript test library
Create turf module for geoprocessing.
var turf = require('/path/to/file');
ppl use promises now. We learned callbacks.
err is always the first argument that bubbles up from a callback function

    if (err) return cb(err)
    console.log('success!')
    var fs = require ('fs')
    var simplify 

    var options = {
    tolerance: ,
    highQuality: true,
    keepProperties: ['NAME']
    }

 -S to save as a dependency
example.js
Object.assign()

const, let vs vars
Publish * 
Quick rundown: requests / turf processing / simplify properties only to a single key.

=====
Cl10:
Bundling to make your clients happy.
mapboxgl geolocate button
Binning - lots of points in clusters
Tinning - works for larger areas

======
Cl11
Geography does not map to property boundaries! Hover over a given county and see 
where water flows in and out.


Michael - Map water boundaries - All US states, boundaries, etc.
Nat Hydrography Dept - USGS - Hydrography
ESRI gdb compressed
Convert to geojson. 50gb water bodies
flowlines  - vector lines on a grid
Use tippecanoe to create vector tiles

self-host the tileserver

======

Cl12
=====
choo framework

Cl 13
=====
Just have one big slider that loads files by the selected hour  

Cl 14
=====
Mapzen comparable tools to mapbox.
use coordinates of geojson line to animate path. Probably shortest distance to next path.
